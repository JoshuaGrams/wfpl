  <h1>Template Test Page</h1>
  
  <!-- Here's the first special thing. This marks the begining of a
  sub-template. It marks a section of template which the php can decide how
  many times to display (including none.) -->
  
  <!--~login start~-->
  <h3>Please Log In Below</h3>

  <form method="get" action="tem_test.php">
    <table summary="">
      <tr>
        <td>Username:</td>

		<!-- Neatly tucked into the next line is a template tag. This will be
		replaced with content from PHP. Every template tag has a name ("user"
		in this case) which says which value from php goes here, and should
		also have an encoding ("attr" in this case). It is important to always
		use the correct encoding. If you are putting the value in an html
		attribute, use "attr" if you are displaying it use "html", if you are
		putting it in a text file or e-mail then leave the encoding off and
		just put ~user~. -->

        <td><input type="text" name="user" value="~user.attr~" /></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Password:</td>

        <!-- there's another template tag named pass -->

        <td><input type="password" name="pass" value="~pass.attr~" /></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td colspan="2"><input type="submit" value="Log In" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </form>

  <!-- and here's the mark for the end of the login sub-template. -->

  <!--~end~-->


  <!-- Now for a more complex example of sub-templates. This whole table is in
  a sub-template so php can decide to display the whole bit or not. First the
  marker for the begining of the sub-template -->

  <!--~foobar_table start~-->
  <h3>All your foobar:</h3>

  <table summary="">
    <tr>
      <th>foo</th>

      <th>bar</th>
    </tr>

	<!-- OK, here's the fun part. We want PHP to be able to display many rows
	in this table, so we make a template with just one row, and mark that row
	as a sub-template named foobar_row -->
    
    <!--~foobar_row start~-->
    <tr>
	  <!-- sorry that the following tag looks a bit like a filename. It isn't.
	  It's simply asking PHP for a value called "foo" encoded as html -->
      <td>~foo.html~</td>

      <td><input value="~bar.attr~" /></td>
    </tr>
    <!-- Here's the end of foobar_row -->
    <!--~end~-->

    <tr>
      <td></td>
      
      <td><input type="submit" /></td>
    </tr>

  </table>
  <!-- and the end of foobar_table -->
  <!--~end~-->
