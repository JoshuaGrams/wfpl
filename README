WFPL (Well Factored PHP Library)

wfpl is a collection of php functions that make it easy to create websites,
including things that are tricky to do from scratch like editing databases.

This branch is an experiment with a different templating system.



It includes:

* A templating system (so all your data/markup can be in the .html file)

* An easy and secure database API

* Functions to help with input validation and pretty printing of many types of
  data.

* metaform (early development) a page to auto-generate code for forms (html
  template, php code, SQL code and even an e-mail template.)

* Easy soft redirects (meaning that in your php code, you can easily specify
  that you'd like a different php file to handle this request.)


wfpl is released under the Gnu GPL v3 or greater.
