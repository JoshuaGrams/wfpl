This directory must be accessible to your PHP files via the relative path: code/wfpl/

The recommended way to do this is to create a directory named "code" in the
main folder of your website. And make symbolic links to that "code" directory
from all directories in your website where you run PHP.

Install wfpl within that "code" directory. That is, these files should be in a
directory named "wfpl" in the "code" directory described above.



INSTALLING METAFORM on apache

metaform.php unfortunately has a couple extra steps.

1) make a directory (named "metaform" in this example) for metaform.

2) make sure code/wfpl is accessible in this directory (link to your main
"code" directory) as described above

3) make a symbolic link to metaform.php called index.php:

ln -s code/wfpl/metaform.php index.php

4) make a file named .htaccess that looks like this:

RewriteEngine  on
RewriteBase    /metaform/
RewriteRule    .*\.tgz$  /metaform/index.php

Note: the above .htaccess file assumes that the "metaform" directory you
created in step one is in the root www directory. If it's in a sub directory
(for example you access it via: http://example.com/my/sub/dir/metaform/) then
replace the two occurrences of "metaform" in the .htaccess file with the path
to that directory (for example "my/sub/dir/metaform").

5) If php can't write to /tmp then you'll have to fix the $tmp_dir in
code/wfpl/tar.php
